Much of the data preprocessing and Stan modeling is conducted on the HBSGrid using the mcmcjob.py script located in Miscellaneous. For those interested in learning more about Stan modeling and the intricacies of the code in general without the nuance of using a computing cluster, please see the tutorial notebooks `Preprocessing Tutorial` and `Running Stan Tutorial`.
